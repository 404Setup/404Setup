I have only been studying Java for a year and have never read professional tutorials and conducted systematic learning, and I lack imagination and perseverance.

This is not my main job, I am busy with other things in reality, so there will not be any paid projects released, and I don't want it to delay me too much.

Golang, Java, and a little bit of Rust, that's all I have.

## About Issues and Support

I turned off the automatic watch, so I can't receive notifications from Github when you create an issue or pull request for my repo. 

So, I decided to disable the Issues feature for most repos. In repos without Issues feature, you should join my Discord server to report issues to me, and I will check those notifications every day.

**Discord**: https://discord.gg/PxgFqNmR2h

**About the compatibility of my works:**
My minimum development version is 1.18.2, which is Java 17. Minecraft below this version will not receive any support, and I will not actively develop any works for it.

No compatibility will be provided for servers or mods that mix Forge/Fabric/NeoForge with Bukkit.

My mod is natively compatible with multiple loaders (Fabric/Forge/Quilt/NeoForge), please do not run it with mods that provide cross-loader compatibility such as Connecter. 

(Example: you use NeoForge and Connecter, but you mistakenly installed the Fabric version of YggdrasilProxy/ProfileCached, you should use the NeoForge version of YggdrasilProxy/ProfileCached)

**@TODO**
> In planning, not yet started or completed.
> 
> Due to various legacy issues in the target environment (specifically Forge),
> these plans may not be actually executed, or only partially executed.
>
> Forks that perform well will be uploaded to Modrinth and Curseforge,
> and the implementation is incomplete (referring to the lack of Forge or
> NeoForge compatibility) or the Forks that are to be merged upstream will
> only provide Release in Github.

- AsyncLocator MultiLoader
- A Morph Mod (Maybe the plan will be cancelled, the priority is not high) **
