I have only been studying Java for a year and have never read professional tutorials and conducted systematic learning, and I lack imagination and perseverance.

This is not my main job, I am busy with other things in reality, so there will not be any paid projects released, and I don't want it to delay me too much.

Golang, Java, and a little bit of Rust, that's all I have.
